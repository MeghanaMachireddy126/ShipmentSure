🚚 ShipmentSure – Data Preprocessing & Preparation
🧠 Project Overview

ShipmentSure is a machine learning project designed to analyze shipment delivery performance and predict whether a shipment will arrive on time or delayed.
The goal of the preprocessing phase is to transform raw shipping data into a clean and structured format suitable for model training and evaluation.

📦 Dataset Information

File Name: Shipping_data.csv

Purpose: To predict on-time delivery based on shipment-related attributes.

Target Variable: on_time

1 → Shipment delivered on time

0 → Shipment delayed

Example Features
Feature Name	Description
shipment_mode	Mode of shipment (Air, Sea, Road, etc.)
origin	Shipment origin location
destination	Destination of the shipment
distance	Distance covered (in km or miles)
weight	Package weight
ship_date	Date when shipment was dispatched
delivery_date	Date of delivery
on_time	Target label (1 = on time, 0 = delayed)
🧹 Data Cleaning

Missing Value Detection:
All columns were checked for missing values using:

df.isnull().sum()


Handling Missing Values:

Missing values were replaced with the mode of each column (df.mode().iloc[0]).

This ensures categorical and numeric consistency without biasing the data.

Consistency Check:

Verified that all columns have the correct data types.

Ensured there are no duplicate or irrelevant records.

🔠 Feature Encoding

Problem: Machine learning models can’t handle categorical text directly.

Solution: Used Label Encoding from Scikit-learn:

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])


Every categorical column (like shipment_mode, origin, destination) was converted to numerical codes.

✂️ Data Splitting

To ensure the model is properly validated:

The dataset was split using 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Performed via:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


This helps evaluate model generalization on unseen data.

🧾 Summary of Preprocessing Steps
Step	Description
1️⃣	Loaded dataset (Shipping_data.csv)
2️⃣	Checked for missing values
3️⃣	Replaced missing values using column modes
4️⃣	Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder
5️⃣	Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
✅ Output of This Phase

Clean, structured dataset ready for model training.

No missing or inconsistent values.

All categorical features encoded.

Data split for reliable model performance testing.

📂 Next Phase

The next step is Model Training, where the preprocessed data is used to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest).

ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ — that helps a lot.
Now that you’ve shared your dataset columns:

origin_warehouse, destination_store, product, on_time, product_quantity, driver_identifier


I’ll update your README so it exactly matches this structure — clean, professional, and ready to use in your GitHub/project folder.

🚚 ShipmentSure – Data Preprocessing & Preparation
🧠 Project Overview

ShipmentSure is a machine learning project focused on predicting whether a shipment will be delivered on time or delayed based on operational data such as product, driver, and route details.
This phase of the project — Data Preprocessing & Preparation — ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and properly structured before model training.

📦 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Shipping_data.csv

Goal: Predict on-time delivery performance.

Target Column: on_time

1 → Shipment delivered on time

0 → Shipment delayed

📋 Features Overview
Column Name	Description	Data Type
origin_warehouse	Warehouse from which the shipment originated	Categorical
destination_store	Store or customer destination	Categorical
product	Product being shipped	Categorical
on_time	Target label (1 = on-time delivery, 0 = delayed)	Numeric
product_quantity	Number of products shipped in the delivery	Numeric
driver_identifier	Unique ID assigned to the delivery driver	Categorical
🧹 Data Cleaning Process

Loading Data

df = pd.read_csv("data/Shipping_data.csv")


Dataset is loaded using Pandas and its structure is verified using:

df.info()
df.head()


Handling Missing Values

Checked for missing data:

df.isnull().sum()


Missing values were replaced with the mode (most frequent value) of each column:

df.fillna(df.mode().iloc[0], inplace=True)


This ensures no loss of data and avoids bias from mean or median imputation.

Validation

Verified there are no duplicates or inconsistent entries.

Confirmed each column has appropriate data types.

🔠 Feature Encoding

Since several features (origin_warehouse, destination_store, product, driver_identifier) are categorical, they were converted into numeric form using Label Encoding:

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].dtype == 'object':
        df[col] = le.fit_transform(df[col])


This step ensures compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

✂️ Data Splitting

After preprocessing, the dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate model performance.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df.drop('on_time', axis=1)
y = df['on_time']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)


Training Set: 80% of data

Testing Set: 20% of data

Purpose: Allows model evaluation on unseen data for realistic performance estimation.
